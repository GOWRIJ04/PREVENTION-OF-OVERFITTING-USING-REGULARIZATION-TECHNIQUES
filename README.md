more short   Ridge regression was most effective in preventing overfitting, outperforming Lasso and ElasticNet. It achieved a low MSE and high R² by shrinking coefficients, proving more stable and accurate, especially with correlated features.

This study examines the performance of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression techniques in preventing 
overfitting and improving model generalization. Ridge regression, which utilizes L2 regularization, stands 
out for its ability to achieve a balance between bias and variance. The Ridge model produces moderate 
coefficients which helps maintain a degree of feature inclusion without excessively penalizing smaller 
weights. The model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3.18 and an R² value of 0.899, indicating 
strong generalization performance. These results suggest that Ridge is effective in reducing overfitting by 
encouraging coefficient shrinkage while retaining all features, ensuring better predictive accuracy and 
model stability.
In contrast, Lasso regression, driven by L1 regularization, exhibits a different approach. Lasso tends to 
sparsify the model by setting some coefficients to zero, especially in cases of highly correlated features. 
However, this sparsity leads to significant performance issues in the presence of multicollinearity, where 
coefficients for highly correlated features are disproportionately large or zeroed out. These metrics 
indicate severe overfitting, poor generalization, and excessive reliance on only a few features, leading to 
inaccurate and unstable predictions.
ElasticNet, which combines Lasso and Ridge properties, attempts to balance the sparsity-inducing effects 
of Lasso with the shrinkage effects of Ridge. However, the model produces coefficients that remain 
somewhat unstable, reflecting a mix of both Lasso’s sparsity and Ridge’s shrinkage. The results highlight 
that ElasticNet suffers from overfitting due to its inability to effectively handle correlated features, similar 
to Lasso, while maintaining some degree of coefficient sparsity.
In conclusion, Ridge regression performs best in preventing overfitting and improving generalization. Its 
moderate coefficients, lower MSE, and high R² values suggest a better balance between model complexity 
and predictive accuracy. In contrast, both Lasso and ElasticNet face significant overfitting issues due to 
their reliance on sparsity and difficulties in dealing with correlated features, leading to poor generalization. 
Therefore, Ridge regression is more suitable for datasets with highly correlated features, providing a more 
stable and accurate model compared to Lasso and ElasticNet.
